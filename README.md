# Multiplayer integration

This project was made for my course "Projects on Biomedical Engineering II". This project implemented a gamification and multiplayer system on a Virtual Reality serious game developed by [Ana Rojo Agust√≠](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ana-rojo-agusti/) under her and [Rodrigo Garcia Carmona's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rgarciacarmona/) guidance.

For more details look at the [PaperMultijugador.pdf](./PaperMultijugador.pdf) file.
