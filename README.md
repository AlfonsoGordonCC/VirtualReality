# Multiplayer integration

This project was made for my course "Projects on Biomedical Engineering II". This project implemented a gamification and multiplayer system on a Virtual Reality serious game developed by [Ana Rojo Agust√≠](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ana-rojo-agusti/) under her and [Rodrigo Garcia Carmona's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rgarciacarmona/) guidance.

The [MP_GameManager](./MP_GameManager.cs) and [Gamification](./Gamification.cs) are completely mine. The [GameManager](./GameManager.cs) is mostly made by Ana, my contributions are located under the GAMIFICATION and ALFONSO_GAMIFICATION_METHODS regions.

For more details look at the [PaperMultijugador.pdf](./PaperMultijugador.pdf) file.
