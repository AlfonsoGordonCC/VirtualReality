# Virtual Reality
This repository contains my project for my "Projects on Biomedical Engineering II" course and the final projects for the courses of the "Exclusive Degree in Virtual Reality for Videogames and Interactive Experiences" by San Pablo-CEU university.

This "Main" branch is just a guideline of the different projects you can find in this repository. Each branch contains the full projects with a report of my contribution.
For team projects, the GitHub/LinkedIn profiles of the members will be mentioned as a way of crediting them.

Last but not least, thanks to [Rodrigo Garcia Carmona](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rgarciacarmona/), the director of the titulation, and to all the professors I had during this titulation, specially to [Ana Rojo Agust√≠](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ana-rojo-agusti/) as she was the one in charge of introducing us to the Virtual Reality programming and being my mentors during this years.
