# Virtual Reality
This repository contains all my work on the Proper Title on Game and XR experiences desing by San Pablo-CEU university.

The "Main" branch contains my specific contributions to the all the projects as well as how do they work in general. Each other branch contains the full project.
For team projects, the GitHub/LinkedIn profiles of the members will be mentioned as a way of crediting them.

Last but not least, thanks to [Rodrigo Garcia Carmona], the director of the titulation, and to all the professors I had during this titulation, specially to [Ana Rojo Agust√≠]() as she was the one in charge of introducing us to the Virtual Reality programming.
