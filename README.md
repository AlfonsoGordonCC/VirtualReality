# Multiplayer integration

This project was made for my course "Projects on Biomedical Engineering II". This project implemented a gamification and multiplayer system on a Virtual Reality serious game developed by [Ana Rojo Agust√≠](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ana-rojo-agusti/) under her and [Rodrigo Garcia Carmona's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rgarciacarmona/) guidance.

For more details look at the [Multiplayer.pdf]() file.
DISCLAIMER: As the project is not originally mine, this branch will only include my code, but NOT the full project.
